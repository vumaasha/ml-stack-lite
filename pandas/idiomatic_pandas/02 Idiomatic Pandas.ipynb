    "# Indexing - Selecting subsets of data\n",
    "**Indexing** or **selecting subsets of data** is one of the most confusing aspects to pandas, which is unfortunate, because it is something done so frequently. There is so much to selecting subsets of data that I have dedicated a [7-part series](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons why selecting subsets of data is confusing:\n",
    "* **Indexing** is a confusing term. **Selecting subsets of data** is more descriptive\n",
    "* Each row and column may be referenced by either their **label** or **integer location**\n",
    "* This dual reference capability is powerful but confusing\n",
    "* The documentation uses the term **position** instead of the more descriptive **integer location**. The indexer **`.iloc`** is an abbreviation of integer location. \n",
    "* There are six indexers, **`[]`**, **`.iloc`**, **`.loc`**, **`.ix`**, **`.at`**, **`.iat`**, that each do something different\n",
    "* **`.ix`** has recently been deprecated in favor of **`.loc`** and **`.iloc`**, but old Stack Overflow answers and tutorials still show it. New questions get asked each day that use this horrible indexer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting help on `[]`, `.iloc`, `loc`\n",
    "If you struggle with these indexers, I encourage you to read my detailed notebook with many practice exercises. [Selecting subsets of Data in Pandas with Exercises](../Selecting%20Subsets%20of%20Data%20in%20Pandas%20part%201.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "# `.ix` deprecation\n",
    "One of the largest changes to the pandas API was the deprecation of the **`.ix`** indexer in version 0.20. The **`.ix`** indexer was versatile, ambiguous, and confusing and personally, I was very excited to see its deprecation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`ix`** was able to select subsets of data by both label and integer location. For instance, if we wanted to select the math and verbal SAT scores for schools with integer location of 5, 505, and 1301 we could do the following:"
